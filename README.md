# SWE-Attendance-Tracker
Project for the RIEEE Hackathon group

SWE CHALLENGE STATEMENT

Currently, our method of taking attendance is performed manually and is very tedious. Keeping
track of attendance is a big part of our organization because it determines who can run for
certain positions and attend certain events, such as the National Conference. Your task is to
design some way to streamline and automate the tracking of attendance.
Requirements/Conditions:
- The information it has to include: name, netID, class year, major
- Has to auto-update (cumulative number of attendances) - no duplicates (if someone
accidentally fills it out twice for the same meeting, it won’t count the second time)
- Either have your own way to input attendance, or update it from the current system
which is via weekly Google Form responses (sheets/CSV)
- Returning members don’t have to input the same information every time
- Add ons → besides weekly general meetings, also record attendance during working
hours (board meetings + committee times)
